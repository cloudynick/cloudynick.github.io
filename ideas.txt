"Game" Ideas
 - Game Finder (prob use OpenAI API)
 - NBA Playoff Bracket Maker/Predictor


Spotify Wrapped
  - Since Spotfiy API can only provide data for the past 12 months, this app could instead read the data the user can request from Spotify,
  and combine it with more recent data whenever the user wants to check. Instead of having to wait the 30 days to obtain their data again, 
  this app can combine the data. If the user does this at least once a year, they can always have up to date 'all time' data for their
  Spotify account. 
    Ideas
     - Can automatically claim data for the user every 12 months so users don't have to manually do it once a year
